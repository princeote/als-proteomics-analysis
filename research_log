combine_proteins.py
Load the FragPipe files
You have to seperate the ALS and Control combined_proteins.tsv files into two folders
Point to the ALS folder and the control folder.

Make sure I can read each combined_protein.tsv using pd.read_csv(..., sep="\t").

3. Tag each sample

Give each dataframe a label so I know where it came from (ALS or Control).

Add a sample name too 

4. Keep only the useful columns

Protein ID, gene name, intensity/abundance columns.

Drop the extra stuff so the dataframes are cleaner.

5. Combine everything

Stack all ALS and control files together with pd.concat.

Reset the index and check the shape.

6. Deal with repeats

Some proteins show up in multiple samples.

Decide if I want to keep every row or reshape later.

7. Save the output

Write the final dataframe to a results folder as a TSV or CSV.

8. Test it

Run the script once, fix any path issues.

Quickly check that the output file looks right.

9. Add comments

Leave short explanations in the code so it’s easy to follow later.

10. Commit to GitHub

Save the progress with a clear commit message.
